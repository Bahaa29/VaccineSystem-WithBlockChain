Vaccine Tracking and Recording remains an important public health concern in the World.The availability 
of information regarding the total process that ensures that a Person takes this vaccine ensure the public 
trust of its excellent healthcare system. However, the lack of availability of these records will lead to generating
assumptions That produce wrong information regarding the health problems appeared. Through the use of a Vaccine Tracking
and Recording System, the process of tracking and recording a vaccine transparency is expected to be enhanced or improved
Risks on improper vaccine documentation and misplaced records can be minimized or totally avoided

# When you finish read this you can do this :
* Create, build, and use the IBM Blockchain Platform service.
* Build a blockchain back-end using Hyperledger Fabric API's
* Deploy a Node.js app that will interact with our deployed smart contract.
* tips of how run this in **Windows OS** and correct integration 

# Included components
*	[IBM Blockchain Platform](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-v2-deploy-iks.html#ibp-v2-deploy-iks) gives you total control of your blockchain network with a user interface that can simplify and accelerate your journey to deploy and manage blockchain components on the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.
*	[IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBMBlockchain.ibm-blockchain-platform) is designed to assist users in developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts -- including connecting to Hyperledger Fabric environments.

# Technologies
* [Hyperledger Fabric v2.0.8](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io) is a platform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned by a modular architecture that  delivers high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility, and scalability.
* [Postman ](https://www.postman.com)is an application to test the api in backend
* [MongoDB-Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) is a database for registration system
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is an open source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes server-side JavaScript code.
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

# Steps 
1. [Clone the Repo](#step-1-clone-the-repo)
2. [From vs code open contract and Connection and vaccine folders](#step-2-from-vs-code-open-contract-and-connection-folders)
3. [Start the Fabric Runtime](#step-3-start-the-fabric-runtime)
4. [Install Contract and deploy contract then export wallet](#step-4-install-contract-and-deploy-contract-then-export-wallet)
5. [Go to Org1 you export and find org1 admin file](#step-5-go-to-org1-you-export-and-find-org1-admin-file)
6. [Run the App](#step-6-run)

## Step 1. Clone the Repo
> https://github.com/Bahaa29/VaccineSystem-WithBlockChain.git

## Step 2. from vs code open contract and connection folders

## Step 5. go to org1 you export and find org1 admin file
> **Note** This step is important when your Blockchain in windwos 
> You need to open the two files key and certifcate and replace the connection details with yours
