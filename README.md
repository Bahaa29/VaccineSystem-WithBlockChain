Vaccine Tracking and Recording remains an important public health concern in the World.The availability 
of information regarding the total process that ensures that a Person takes this vaccine ensure the public 
trust of its excellent healthcare system. However, the lack of availability of these records will lead to generating
assumptions That produce wrong information regarding the health problems appeared. Through the use of a Vaccine Tracking
and Recording System, the process of tracking and recording a vaccine transparency is expected to be enhanced or improved
Risks on improper vaccine documentation and misplaced records can be minimized or totally avoided

# When you finish read this you can do this :
